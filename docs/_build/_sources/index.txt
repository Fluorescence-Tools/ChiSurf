ChiSURF
=======

*Analyze (single-molecule) fluorescence data to generate models.*

ChiSURF (Chi Surface, SUper Resolution FRET or CS) is a software-suite dedicated
to the analysis of fluorescence data and the generation and analysis of structural
models based on fluorescence measurements.

In particular ChiSURF is capable to analyze TCSPC, FCS and stopped-flow data. The
frame-work allows to extend the capabilities relatively easy as in addition to the
user-interface an API is provided.

ChiSurf supports so far Windows and Linux (Ubuntu 14.04, tested). MacOS support
should be possible but due to time limitations I'm not actively working on it.

Feedback
========

The best way to report a bug or request is to contact me personally. Just
pass by in my office and we can try to reproduce the bug. Right now ChiSURF
is not stable. Therefore it is not officially released in the internet.

If you want to contribute the best thing you can do is writing user-documentations,
examples and tutorials.
