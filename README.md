ChiSurf is a software package to analyze fluorescence data.
* Analysis of multiple data sets
* Pre-processing of raw experimental data (e.g. correlation analysis)
* Diverse data representations (FCS, fluorescence decays, etc.)
* Structural analysis of FRET-data (support of the fluorescence positioning system, FPS)
